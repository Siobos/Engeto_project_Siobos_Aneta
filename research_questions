RESEARCH QUESTIONS (RQ): 

RQ 1) Are wages rising in all industries over the years, or falling in some?

WITH t_aneta_siobos_project_sql_primary_final_calculations AS (
SELECT *,
LEAD(avg_value, 1) OVER (
PARTITION BY category_code
ORDER BY year
	) results
FROM t_aneta_siobos_project_sql_primary_final taspspf
)
SELECT *,
	CASE
        WHEN results > avg_value THEN 'increase'
        WHEN results < avg_value THEN 'decrease'
        WHEN results = avg_value THEN 'stagnation'
        ELSE '-'
    END AS grow
FROM t_aneta_siobos_project_sql_primary_final_calculations;

RQ 2) How many liters of milk and kilograms of bread can be bought in the first and last comparable periods in the available price and wage data?

SELECT YEAR, ROUND(avg(avg_value),2) AS avg_value, unit
FROM t_aneta_siobos_project_sql_primary_final taspspf  
WHERE YEAR IN (2006, 2018) AND category_code IN ('A','B','C','D','E','F','G','H','I','J','K','L','M','N','O','P','Q','R','S')
GROUP BY YEAR
UNION
SELECT YEAR, avg_value, unit
FROM t_aneta_siobos_project_sql_primary_final taspspf  
WHERE YEAR IN (2006, 2018) AND category_code IN ('111301','114201')
GROUP BY YEAR, category_code 

RQ 3) Which food category is increasing in price the slowest (has the lowest percentage year-on-year increase)?

WITH czechia_price_selection_calculation AS (
SELECT *,
LEAD(avg_value, 1) OVER (
PARTITION BY category_code
ORDER BY year
	) lead_function
FROM czechia_price_selection
)
SELECT *, ROUND((lead_function-avg_value)/(avg_value)*100,0) AS YOY_change
FROM czechia_price_selection_calculation;

Better detail:

WITH czechia_price_selection_calculation AS (
SELECT *,
LEAD(avg_value, 1) OVER (
PARTITION BY category_code
ORDER BY year
	) lead_function
FROM czechia_price_selection
)
SELECT category_code, name, unit, ROUND(AVG(lead_function-avg_value)/(avg_value)*100,2) AS AVG_YOY_change
FROM czechia_price_selection_calculation
GROUP BY category_code

RQ 4) Has there been a year in which the year-on-year increase in food prices was significantly higher than wage growth (greater than 10%)?

WITH czechia_price_selection_YOY_change AS (
    SELECT *,
           LEAD(avg_value, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY category_code ORDER BY YEAR) lead_function
    FROM czechia_price_selection
)
, czechia_payroll_selection_YOY_change AS (
    SELECT *,
           LEAD(avg_value, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY category_code ORDER BY YEAR) lead_function
    FROM czechia_payroll_selection
)
SELECT 
    p.year,
    p.avg_value,
    pr.YEAR,
    p.lead_function AS lead_function_price,
    pr.avg_value,
    ROUND((p.lead_function - p.avg_value) / p.avg_value * 100, 2) AS YOY_change_price,
    pr.lead_function AS lead_function_payroll,
    ROUND((pr.lead_function - pr.avg_value) / pr.avg_value * 100, 2) AS YOY_change_payroll
FROM czechia_price_selection_YOY_change p
INNER JOIN czechia_payroll_selection_YOY_change pr ON p.year = pr.year
GROUP BY pr.year;
